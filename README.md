### Introduction

Ecstasy is a modern C++ library that implements an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture with a strong focus on performance, flexibility, and ease of use.

Some key features include:

- Advanced usage of templates to shift computations from runtime to compile time, resulting in faster and more efficient applications (in theory, because I don't know how to make benchmarks).
- Support for complex queries using boolean operations (And/Or/Xor/Not) to filter and retrieve entities based on component criteria.
- Built-in integrations for common game mechanics, such as events, user actions, and graphic libraries to simplify game development.
- Designed with the zero-overhead principle in mind to ensure minimal runtime impact and maximum performance.
- Provides an excellent opportunity for cooking eggs during compilation ðŸ˜‰

Get started with Ecstasy today and experience a new level of performance and productivity in your ECS-based projects!

### Code Example

_The following is a basic example extracted from the [Tutorial](https://andreaslrx.github.io/ecstasy/md_doc__tutorial.html)._

```cpp
#include <ecstasy/registry/Registry.hpp>
#include <ecstasy/system/ISystem.hpp>

struct Position {
    float x;
    float y;
};

struct Velocity {
    float x;
    float y;
};

struct Movement : public ecstasy::ISystem {
    void run(ecstasy::Registry &registry) override final
    {
        for (auto [position, velocity] : registry.query<Position, const Velocity>()) {
            position.x += velocity.x;
            position.y += velocity.y;
        }
    }
};


int main() {
    // Declare your registry
    ecstasy::Registry registry;

    // Register your systems
    registry.addSystem<Movement>();

    // Populate the registry with some entities
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        auto builder = registry.entityBuilder().with<Position>(i * 2, i * 10);
        if (i % 2 == 0)
            builder.with<Velocity>(i * 10, i * 2);
        ecstasy::Entity entity = builder.build();
        // If needed, use the entity
    }

    while (true) {
        registry.runSystems();
    }
}
```

### Building
